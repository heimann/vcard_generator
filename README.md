# vCard Generator

This is a super simple python script that takes a couple of inputs and generates
a vCard that can be shared with most phones. I built this to use with [Twilio's
messaging co-pilot](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/sending-messages-copilot) for [Purple](https://getpurple.io)

Great. Email me at david@getpurple.io.

**What about my question?**
There's really not much to ask here.

**I feel like this is too simple, you need to add X**
I agree, this is stupid simple and basically just built for my purpose. Feel free
to add to it or shoot me an e-mail with some suggestions. I might add some stuff
overtime.
